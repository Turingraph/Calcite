On “aster morning in the year I took my six-year-old 
son by the hand and walking fron my home town toward the 
valleys and forests of the Carpathian For nearly 
eight months we livea in barns, attics and makeshift cabins. “ith 
the generous help of an unusually courageous man, we managed to 
survive Europe's greatest fit of madness. Those walked in 
the opposite direction on that Easter day were less fortunate. 
They were taken in trainloads to places whose once obscure nanes 
are now, and forever will be, synonymous with terror, evil and 
death. What follows is our story of survival told to the best 
of my ability, in plain, simple language. 
In March of 1944 the SS troops took over the internal affairs 
of Hungary and to organize the deportation of the Jews. 
fo the Nazis this was a routine assignment; within hours all local 
officials were informed of operational plans. The high command 
issued a directive designed to placate Jewish fears and induce 
cooperation. It was announced that the Jews would be shipped to 
Polarsi as an emergency labor force and that they, were only beins 
drafted for temporary work. There were many who believed this 
version. Others, less credulous, resigred themselves and hoped for 
the best. Still others began to make plans for escape. By 
13 the Hungarian Jews were being rounded up from all over the 
country in what was once a huge brick factory. The rest is well 
known. I war working in Unevar and came home on weekends. 
At that time it was no longer possible fer a to travel freely.
