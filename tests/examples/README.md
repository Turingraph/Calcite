The purpose of all sub folders inside this forder is for checking if `img_process_class/`, `ocr_box/` 
and `basic_ocr/` works as expected with various image inputs.

The purpose of `tests_all_examples.sh` is for running all Python files in this directory. 

Warning : Don't use `bash ../python3_tests_subfolder.sh` because the Python files will produce output in wrong folders.
