# Folder structure

This folder contains
1.	`app/`
-	Purpose : Contains our code that is used as the web app page and can be accessed by URI.
2.	`ui/`
-	Purpose : Contains only reusable `ui/` components that is computed on the Browser instead of Server.

We might add `backend/` which is Next JS based backend in the future, depending if Next JS is suitable for our project.
